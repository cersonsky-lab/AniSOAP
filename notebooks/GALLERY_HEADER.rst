Examples
========

Here is a collection of examples that may prove useful. These examples can be viewed in the gallery below, or can be viewed on Github:

* `Example 1 <https://github.com/cersonsky-lab/AniSOAP/blob/main/notebooks/example01_invariances_of_powerspectrum_test.ipynb>`_
* `Example 2 <https://github.com/cersonsky-lab/AniSOAP/blob/main/notebooks/example02_learn_benzene.ipynb>`_

The 1st example is a minimal example demonstrating the various ways creating an AniSOAP vector from an ase.Atoms object, either via taking manual Clebsch-Gordan products of the expansion coefficients, or via the `power-spectrum` convenience methods. It also demonstrates the rotational and translational invariance.

The 2nd example is an example demonstrating how AniSOAP can be used to coarse-grain benzene and learn benzene crystal energies through linear regression.
