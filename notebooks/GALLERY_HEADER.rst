Examples
========

Here is a collection of examples that may prove useful.

The 1st example is a minimal example demonstrating how to create an AniSOAP vector from an ase.Atoms object. It also demonstrates the rotational and translational invariance.

The 2nd example is an example demonstrating how AniSOAP can be used to coarse-grain benzene and learn benzene crystal energies through linear regression.
