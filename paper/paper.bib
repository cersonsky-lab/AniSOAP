abstract = {Creating fast and accurate force fields is a long-standing challenge in computational chemistry and materials science. Recently, several equivariant message passing neural networks (MPNNs) have been shown to outperform models built using other approaches in terms of accuracy. However, most MPNNs suffer from high computational cost and poor scalability. We propose that these limitations arise because MPNNs only pass two-body messages leading to a direct relationship between the number of layers and the expressivity of the network. In this work, we introduce MACE, a new equivariant MPNN model that uses higher body order messages. In particular, we show that using four-body messages reduces the required number of message passing iterations to just two, resulting in a fast and highly parallelizable model, reaching or exceeding state-of-the-art accuracy on the rMD17, 3BPA, and AcAc benchmark tasks. We also demonstrate that using higher order messages leads to an improved steepness of the learning curves.},

	abstract = {Physics-based, atom-centered machine learning (ML) representations have been instrumental to the effective integration of ML within the atomistic simulation community. Many of these representations build off the idea of atoms as having spherical, or isotropic, interactions. In many communities, there is often a need to represent groups of atoms, either to increase the computational efficiency of simulation via coarse-graining or to understand molecular influences on system behavior. In such cases, atom-centered representations will have limited utility, as groups of atoms may not be well-approximated as spheres. In this work, we extend the popular Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) ML representation for systems consisting of non-spherical anisotropic particles or clusters of atoms. We show the power of this anisotropic extension of SOAP, which we deem AniSOAP, in accurately characterizing liquid crystal systems and predicting the energetics of Gay–Berne ellipsoids and coarse-grained benzene crystals. With our study of these prototypical anisotropic systems, we derive fundamental insights on how molecular shape influences mesoscale behavior and explain how to reincorporate important atom–atom interactions typically not captured by coarse-grained models. Moving forward, we propose AniSOAP as a flexible, unified framework for coarse-graining in complex, multiscale simulation.},

          , 
            Due to the subtle balance of intermolecular interactions that govern structure–property relations, predicting the stability of crystal structures formed from molecular building blocks is a highly non-trivial scientific problem. A particularly active and fruitful approach involves classifying the different combinations of interacting chemical moieties, as understanding the relative energetics of different interactions enables the design of molecular crystals and fine-tuning of their stabilities. While this is usually performed based on the empirical observation of the most commonly encountered motifs in known crystal structures, we propose to apply a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine-learning techniques to automate the construction of an extensive library of molecular building blocks. We introduce a structural descriptor tailored to the prediction of the binding (lattice) energy and apply it to a curated dataset of organic crystals, exploiting its atom-centered nature to obtain a data-driven assessment of the contribution of different chemical groups to the lattice energy of the crystal. We then interpret this library using a low-dimensional representation of the structure–energy landscape and discuss selected examples of the insights into crystal engineering that can be extracted from this analysis, providing a complete database to guide the design of molecular materials.},

              Evaluating the (dis)similarity of crystalline, disordered and molecular compounds is a critical step in the development of algorithms to navigate automatically the configuration space of complex materials. For instance, a structural similarity metric is crucial for classifying structures, searching chemical space for better compounds and materials, and driving the next generation of machine-learning techniques for predicting the stability and properties of molecules and materials. In the last few years several strategies have been designed to compare atomic coordination environments. In particular, the smooth overlap of atomic positions (SOAPs) has emerged as an elegant framework to obtain translation, rotation and permutation-invariant descriptors of groups of atoms, underlying the development of various classes of machine-learned inter-atomic potentials. Here we discuss how one can combine such local descriptors using a regularized entropy match (REMatch) approach to describe the similarity of both whole molecular and bulk periodic structures, introducing powerful metrics that enable the navigation of alchemical and structural complexities within a unified framework. Furthermore, using this kernel and a ridge regression method we can predict atomization energies for a database of small organic molecules with a mean absolute error below 1 kcal mol

            A generalized understanding of protein dynamics is an unsolved scientific problem, the solution of which is critical to the interpretation of the structure-function relationships that govern essential biological processes. Here, we approach this problem by constructing coarse-grained molecular potentials based on artificial neural networks and grounded in statistical mechanics. For training, we build a unique dataset of unbiased all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of approximately 9 ms for twelve different proteins with multiple secondary structure arrangements. The coarse-grained models are capable of accelerating the dynamics by more than three orders of magnitude while preserving the thermodynamics of the systems. Coarse-grained simulations identify relevant structural states in the ensemble with comparable energetics to the all-atom systems. Furthermore, we show that a single coarse-grained potential can integrate all twelve proteins and can capture experimental structural features of mutated proteins. These results indicate that machine learning coarse-grained potentials could provide a feasible approach to simulate and understand protein dynamics.},

	abstract = {We develop a machine-learning method for coarse-graining condensed-phase molecular systems using anisotropic particles. The method extends currently available high-dimensional neural network potentials by addressing molecular anisotropy. We demonstrate the flexibility of the method by parametrizing single-site coarse-grained models of a rigid small molecule (benzene) and a semi-flexible organic semiconductor (sexithiophene), attaining structural accuracy close to the all-atom models for both molecules at a considerably lower computational expense. The machine-learning method of constructing the coarse-grained potential is shown to be straightforward and sufficiently robust to capture anisotropic interactions and many-body effects. The method is validated through its ability to reproduce the structural properties of the small molecule’s liquid phase and the phase transitions of the semi-flexible molecule over a wide temperature range.},
