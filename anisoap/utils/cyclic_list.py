    This is a simple class that only exists to be used as a "private" cache
    for computed ClebschGordanReal matrices (self._cg)

    It only stores last n CG matrices computed for distinct l_max values. Since
    it is specialized to store (l_max, cg matrix) pair, it is NOT supposed to be
    used to cache any other things. While type of "value" (in `(key, value)` pair)
    does not matter as much, the type of `key` MUST BE A 32-BIT INTEGER with
    most significant bit unused, as it performs bitwise operations on the most
    significant bit to store and check the replacement flags.

    It will replace the entries using something called "clock algorithm" for page
    replacement, which mimics the "least recently used" algorithm but with less
    computation requirement.
