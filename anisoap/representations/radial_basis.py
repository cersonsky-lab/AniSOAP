        """
        Apply an in-place orthonormalization on the features, using Lodwin Symmetric Orthonormalization.
        Each block in the features TensorMap uses a GTO set of l + 2n, so we must take the appropriate slices of
        the overlap matrix to compute the orthonormalization matrix.
        An instructive example of Lodwin Symmetric Orthonormalization of a 2-element basis set is found here:
        https://booksite.elsevier.com/9780444594365/downloads/16755_10030.pdf

        Parameters:
            features: A TensorMap whose blocks' values we wish to orthonormalize. Note that features is modified in place, so a
            copy of features must be made before the function if you wish to retain the unnormalized values.
            radial_basis: An instance of _RadialBasis

        Returns:
            normalized_features: features containing values multiplied by proper normalization factors.
