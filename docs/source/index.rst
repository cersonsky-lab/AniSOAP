Welcome to AniSOAP's documentation!
===================================

**AniSOAP** is a Python library for creating descriptors of chemical systems 
suitable for machine learning use.  This project aims to extend the popular Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) 
descriptors to coarse-grained systems consisting of aspherical particles 
with anisotropic interactions.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.
